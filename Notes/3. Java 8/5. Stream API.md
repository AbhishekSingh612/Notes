- **Stream** (`java.util.stream.Stream<T>`) is a sequence of elements which can be created out of collections or any other I/O resource. Example 
	```java
	Stream<String> nameStream = Stream.of("Abhishek", "Ankur", "Ashok");
    //OR
	List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Abhishek", "Ankur", "Ashok");
	Stream<String> nameStream = names.stream();
	```
- Can be performed sequentially using `stream()` or in parallel using `parallelStream()` 
- `java.util.stream` contains classes for proccessing sequence of elements
- Stream pipeline includes :-
	1. *Creation*: It takes collection or any other I/O resource and creates its Stream
	2. *Operations*: 
		1. *Intermediate*: Allow chaining i.e. It takes `Stream<T>` and outputs new `Stream<T>`
		2. *Terminal*: It takes `Stream<T>` but returns result of definitive type
- Any operation performed on stream is not reflected in the source
