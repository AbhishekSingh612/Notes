### Serverless
-   Serverless is a concept in which **developers don't have to manage servers anymore**
-   Initially, serverless meant **Function as a Service (FaaS)**, but now it encompasses anything that is remotely managed (databases, messaging, storage, etc.)
-   Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers, it just means they are **not managed or provisioned by the user**
-   AWS is a pioneer in serverless technology and includes components such as 
	1. AWS Lambda, 
	2. DynamoDB,
	3. Cognito,
	4. API Gateway,
	5. S3,
	6. SNS,
	7. SQS,
	8. Kinesis Data Firehose,
	9. Aurora Serverless,
	10. Step Functions,
	11. Fargate
-   Serverless applications are designed to **scale on demand**, and the user only **pays for what they use**
