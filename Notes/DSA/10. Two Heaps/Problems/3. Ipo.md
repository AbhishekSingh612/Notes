## Problem: 
 Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return _the final maximized capital_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

	Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
	After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
	With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
	Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
	Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**

	Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
	Output: 6

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	class Solution {
	    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
		    // Min Heap : top is min Capital
	        Queue<Pair> minCapital = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(p->p.capital));
	        // Max Heap : top is max profit
	        Queue<Pair> maxProfit = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(p->-p.profit));
	
			// Store all capital and profit in the minCapital heap
	        for(int i=0; i<capital.length; i++){
	            minCapital.offer(new Pair(capital[i], profits[i]));
	        }
	
	        while(k-- >0){
			    // Select all projects that can be started based
			    // on available capital W
	            while(!minCapital.isEmpty() && minCapital.peek().capital <= w){
	                maxProfit.offer(minCapital.poll());
	            }

				// If no project can be started break
	            if(maxProfit.isEmpty()) break;

				// Else start the project with max profit
				// Add profit to capital
	            w += maxProfit.poll().profit;
	        }
	        return w;
	    }
	}
	class Pair{
	    int capital;
	    int profit;
	
	    public Pair(int capital, int profit){
	        this.capital = capital;
	        this.profit = profit;
	    }
	}
