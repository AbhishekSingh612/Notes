## Problem: 
 Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

	Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
	Output: 2

**Example 2:**

	Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
	Output: 3

## Notes: 
- Brute force will be to use Hashmap and find the duplicate but question asks to solve in constant space

1. If we can modify the array :
	- O(nlogn) : sorting and finding duplicate 
	- O(n) : We can solve this using the cyclic sort pattern but that will be by modifying the array
2. Without modifying the array: 
	1. O(NLogN) : Binary search : Idea is that  a non duplicate number x will have x numbers smaller that or equal to it (if no duplicate is there) but if it is more we have found a candidate and we further look for smaller number 
	2. O(N) : Using fast and slow pointer : 
			Idea is that all numbers in the array are in range \[1, n\] and we can say all these numbers will be valid indexes as well then we can mark these indexes as visited somehow(Assume) if there is no duplicate we should visit each index only once, if a index is visited twice then that index is a duplicate number
			Notice when we visit the duplicate index we will again repeat the path that led us here. For example \[2, 3, 1, 2\] we visit the index in following sequence 2, 3, 1,
