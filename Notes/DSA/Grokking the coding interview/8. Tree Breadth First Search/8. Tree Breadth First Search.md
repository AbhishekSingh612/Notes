### Basic BFS 
```java
	Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
	q.offer(root);

	while(!q.isEmpty()) {
		TreeNode curr = q.poll();

		// Process Node
		if(curr.left!=null) q.offer(curr.left);
		if(curr.right!=null) q.offer(curr.right);
	}
```

### Level wise BFS
```java
	Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
	q.offer(root);

	int level = 0;
	while(!q.isEmpty()) {
		level++;
	
		int size = q.size();
		while(size-->0){
			TreeNode curr = q.poll();

			// Process Node
			if(curr.left!=null) q.offer(curr.left);
			if(curr.right!=null) q.offer(curr.right);
		}
	}

	return level;
```

### Level Order using DFS
```java
	public void dfs(TreeNode node, List<List<Integer>> result, int level){
        if(node == null)
            return;

        if(result.size() <= level){
            result.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        result.get(level).add(node.val);

        dfs(node.left, result, level+1);
        dfs(node.right, result, level+1);
    }
```

### Time Complexity: 
As we know time complexity of BFS is O(V + E) for any graph.
In case of binary tree:
- V (number of nodes) = N
- E (number of edges) = N - 1
Hence O(N + (N-1)) = **O(N)**
