## Problem: 
 Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

## Notes: 
- Level wise BFS (To calculate current depth) and returning when we find first leaf node

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null) return 0;

        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(root);

        int level = 0;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            level++;

            int size = q.size();
            while(size-->0) {
                TreeNode curr = q.poll();

                if(curr.left==null && curr.right==null) return level;
                
                if(curr.left!=null) q.offer(curr.left);
                if(curr.right!=null) q.offer(curr.right);
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
	```
