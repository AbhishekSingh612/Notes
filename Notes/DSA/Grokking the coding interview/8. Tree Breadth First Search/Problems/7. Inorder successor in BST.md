## Problem: 
 Problem Statement:
Given a binary search tree (BST) where each node has a distinct value, find the in-order successor of a given node `p`. The in-order successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p`'s key.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the BST is in the range \[1, 10^4\].
- Each node in the tree has a distinct integer value.

Example:
```
Input: [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 2
      5
     / \
    3   6
   / \
  2   4
 /
1

Output: 3
```

Explanation:
In the given BST, the in-order traversal is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The in-order successor of node with value 2 is the node with value 3.

## Notes: 
- Solution is based on the fact that inorder traversal of BST is ascending order of nodes value
- So in-order successor is the value just greater than the given node value
- We start at root compare the root value and if given node value is less that store root as possible successor and move to left of tree
- we continue until root is null then we return the latest possible successor as answer

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java	
	public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {  
	    TreeNode successor = null;  
	    while(root!=null) {  
	        if (root.val > p.val) {  
	            successor = root;  
	            root = root.left;  
	        } else
	            root = root.right;  
	    }    
		return successor;  
	}
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(N)
	- Space: O(1)
