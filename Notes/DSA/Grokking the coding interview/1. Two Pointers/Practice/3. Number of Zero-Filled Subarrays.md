## Problem: 
 Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of **subarrays** filled with_ `0`.
>A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

	Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
	Output: 6
	Explanation: 
	There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
	There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
	There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size 
	more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.

**Example 2:**

	Input: nums = [0,0,0,2,0,0]
	Output: 9

## Notes: 
- Counting subarray concept same as [[7. Subarray Product Less Than K]] [Leetcode Editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-zero-filled-subarrays/editorial/)
- Here we maintain window of all zeroes and on adding new zero to our window, this zero increases the number of subarray by the size of window (count = count + windowSize) and when we find a non zero element we move the left pointer ahead of right pointer (as in next iteration this element will be checked) also when left = right + 1, count does not increment (right - right - 1 + 1 == 0)

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
    public long zeroFilledSubarray(int[] nums) {
        long count = 0;

        int left = 0;
        for(int right = 0; right<nums.length; right++){
            if(nums[right] != 0)
                left = right + 1;
			//else 
	            count += right - left + 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(N)
	- Space: O(1)
