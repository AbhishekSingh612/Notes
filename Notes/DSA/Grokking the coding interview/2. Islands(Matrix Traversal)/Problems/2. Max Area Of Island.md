## Problem: 
 You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

	Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
	Output: 6
	Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2:**

	Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
	Output: 0

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Notes: 
- Similar to previous problem here, Here we keep on adding 1 for each valid cells

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	int r, c;
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        r = grid.length;
        c = grid[0].length;
        int max = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i<r; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<c; j++){
                if(grid[i][j]==1){
                    max = Math.max(max, dfs(grid, i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }

    public int dfs(int[][] grid, int x, int y){
        if(x<0 || y<0 || x >= r || y>=c || grid[x][y] == 0)
            return 0;
        
        grid[x][y] = 0;
        return 1 + dfs(grid, x, y-1)
                 + dfs(grid, x-1, y)
                 + dfs(grid, x, y+1)
                 + dfs(grid, x+1, y);
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(Cells) == O(R\*C)
	- Space: O(1)
