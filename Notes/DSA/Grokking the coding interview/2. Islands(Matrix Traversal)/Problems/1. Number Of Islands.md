## Problem: 
 Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

	Input: grid = [
	  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
	  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
	  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
	  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
	]
	Output: 1

**Example 2:**

	Input: grid = [
	  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
	  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
	  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
	  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
	]
	Output: 3

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Notes: 
- We need to traverse each island (== 1) and mark them ( == 0 ), Then every time we come across 1 we know we this is a new island ( as this island was not connected to previous islands or else is would not be 1), So we increment the count

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        
        int count = 0;
        for(int r = 0; r < grid.length; r++) {
            for(int c = 0; c < grid[0].length; c++) {
                if(grid[r][c]!='0'){
                    count++;
                    dfs(grid, r, c);
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public void dfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
        if(r < 0 || r>=grid.length || c<0 || c>=grid[0].length || grid[r][c] == '0')
            return;

        grid[r][c] = '0';

        dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r, c - 1);
        dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(No. of cells) == O(R\*C) : where R is number of rows and C is number of columns 
	- Space: O(1)
