## Problem: 
 Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive. There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

*Follow-up:* You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

	Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
	Output: 2

**Example 2:**

	Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
	Output: 3

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10`<sup>5</sup>
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

**Follow up:**

- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
