This pattern describes an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, we either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap.

Given two intervals (`a` and `b`), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:

1. `a` and `b`do not overlap
2. `a` and `b` overlap, `b` ends after `a`
3. `a` completely overlaps `b`
4. `a` and `b` overlap, `a` ends after `b`
5. `b` completly overlaps `a`
6. `a` and `b` do not overlap

Understanding the above six cases will help us in solving all intervals related problems.

**Check if overlapping**
 if `min(EndA​, EndB) − max(StartA​, StartB​​) >= 0` then overlapping else not

**Total Interval after merge**
- Start = Min (StartA, StartB)
- End = Max (EndA, EndB)

**Overlapped Interval**
- Start = Max (StartA, StartB)
- End = Min (EndA, EndB)


```java
    // Returns true if the intervals a and b have a common element.
    boolean doesIntervalsOverlap(int[] a, int[] b) {
        return Math.min(a[1], b[1]) - Math.max(a[0], b[0]) >= 0;
    }

    // Return the interval having all the elements of intervals a and b.
    int[] mergeIntervals(int[] a, int[] b) {
       return new int[]{Math.min(a[0], b[0]), Math.max(a[1], b[1])};
    }
```
