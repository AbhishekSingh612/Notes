Island problem includes a Matrix which we need to traverse in order to find the answer. 

### Template
Generally we need to perform DFS/BFS to traverse the matrix. Below is the template of dfs used to traverse matrix.

DFS (Grid, x, y):
1. Check whether the current row and col are inbound. 
2. Check the condition (Given in the problem) which governs whether we can traverse the current cell or not
3. Mark the current cell visited (Change the value of current cell)
4. Call DFS on all 4 directions

### Example
```java
public void dfs(int[][] grid, int r, int c) {
	if(r < 0 || r>=grid.length || c<0 || c>=grid[0].length || grid[r][c] == 0)
		return;
		
	grid[r][c] = 0;
		
	dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
	dfs(grid, r, c - 1);
	dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
	dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
}
```

### Additional Information:

#### Complexity analysis for Matrix dfs:
1.  Time Complexity:
    -   Let's assume the grid has dimensions `m` x `n`.
    -   The DFS function is recursively called for each cell in the grid.
    -   In the worst case, where all cells are land (1), the DFS function will be called for each cell.
    -   Each recursive call checks four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) and recursively calls the DFS function on them if they are within the grid bounds.
    -   Therefore, the time complexity of the DFS function can be considered as O(4 * (m * n)) = O(m * n).
    -   Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(m * n)**, where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid.

1.  Space Complexity:
    -   The space complexity of the solution depends on the space used for the recursive call stack during the DFS traversal.
    -   In the worst case, where the grid is entirely land and has dimensions `m` x `n`, the maximum depth of the recursion will be `m * n`.
    -   Therefore, the space complexity of the solution is **O(m * n)** for the call stack.
