## Problem: 
 Given a 2D array of characters `grid` of size `m x n`, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the **same value** in `grid`.

A cycle is a path of **length 4 or more** in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the **same value** of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1)` is invalid because from `(1, 2)` we visited `(1, 1)` which was the last visited cell.

Return `true` if any cycle of the same value exists in `grid`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/15/1.png)**

	Input: grid = [["a","a","a","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","a","a","a"]]
	Output: true
	Explanation: There are two valid cycles shown in different colors in the image below:

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/15/22.png)**

	Input: grid = [["c","c","c","a"],["c","d","c","c"],["c","c","e","c"],["f","c","c","c"]]
	Output: true
	Explanation: There is only one valid cycle highlighted in the image below:

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/15/3.png)**

	Input: grid = [["a","b","b"],["b","z","b"],["b","b","a"]]
	Output: false

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `grid` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Notes: 
- If a cell is already marked visited and it is not the parent of current cell then we found a cycle 

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public boolean containsCycle(char[][] grid) {
        
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];

        for(int i = 0; i<grid.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<grid[0].length; j++){
                if(!visited[i][j] && dfs(grid, i, j, visited, i, j)){
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    int[][] dirs = {{1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}, {0,1}}; 
    public boolean dfs(char[][] grid, int x, int y, boolean visited[][], int px, int py){
        visited[x][y] = true;

        for(int[] dir : dirs){
            int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];

            // If new x,y are out of bound or are not connected (different value)
            // Then we skip this 
            if(!isValid(nx, ny, grid) || grid[x][y] != grid[nx][ny])
                continue;
            
            // If Valid x,y and it is not visited we visit it
            if(!visited[nx][ny]){
                if(dfs(grid, nx, ny, visited, x, y))
                    return true;
            } 
            
            // If new x,y are already visited 
            // and they are not parent
            // then we found a cycle (this is also known as backedge) 
            else if (px!=nx || py!=ny) 
                return true;
        }


        // If no backedge was found
        return false;
    }

    public boolean isValid(int x, int y, char[][] grid){
        return !(x<0 || y<0 || x>=grid.length || y>=grid[0].length);
    }
	
	```
