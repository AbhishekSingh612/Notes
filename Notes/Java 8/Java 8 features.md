## Features introduced in Java 8

Java 8 introduced several new features and improvements to the Java language, including:

1. **Lambda expressions**, which allow developers to write concise, functional code.
2. **Stream API**, which allows developers to perform functional-style operations on collections of data.
3. **Method references**, which allow developers to use shorthand notation for referring to methods.
4. **Functional interfaces**, which are interfaces that have a single abstract method.
5. **Optional class**, which is a container class for an optional value.
6. **Date and Time API**, which was completely redesigned and allows for improved handling of date and time values.
7. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**, which allows developers to run JavaScript code within a Java program.
